---------------------------------README-----------------------------------

This is a coursework project i did during my masters

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

THERE ARE 4 FILES IN TOTAL INCLUDING README FILE.

'main.py' 'input1.txt' 'input2.txt' 'README.txt'

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
This project simulates real time task scheduling algorithms and observed its performance.
it is executed in an Linux environment.

input1.txt and input2.txt are files that contain the task data such as deadline and execution time

main.py file performs Rate monotonic(RM) and Earlies deadline first(EDF) scheduling algorithms. 
The algorithms are even optimized to the tasks to have better efficiency.
All the preformances are observed.

							HOW TO RUN

Used Python(python3) in an linux based system(ubuntu)

To run the scheduling algorithm

	The format:	>> python3 main.py [input_file] [algorithm] [Energy_efficient or not]
	
	input_file are : 'input1.txt' or 'input2.txt'
	algorithm : 'RM' or 'EDF'
	Energy_efficient : 'EE' or ''(empty)

For each scenario an output text file is generated.
