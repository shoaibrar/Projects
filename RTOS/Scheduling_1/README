---------------------------------README-----------------------------------

This is a coursework project that i did during my masters

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

THERE ARE 5 FILES IN TOTAL INCLUDING README FILE.

'rr.c' 'sjf.c' 'fcfs.c' 'mlfq.c' 'README.txt'

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
This project simulates scheduling algorithms and observed its performance.
it is executed in an Linux environment.

rr.c file performs round robin scheduling

sjf.c files performs Shortest job first sheduling

fcfs.c file performs First come First serve scheduling

mlfq.c file performs multi level feedback queue scheduling



							HOW TO RUN


ROUND ROBIN
	For Round Robin, compile
										"gcc rr.c"
	execute the file 					 " ./a.out N "

SHORTEST JOB FIRST
	For SJF, compile
										"gcc sjf.c"
	execute the file 				     "./a.out"

FIRST COME FIRST SERVE
	For FCFS, compile	
												"gcc fcfs.c"
	execute the file 				     		"./a.out"

MULTI-LEVEL FEEDBACK QUEUE
	For MLFQ compile
												"gcc mlfq.c"
	execute the file 				    		"./a.out"
